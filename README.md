# Bots.WoW.Fishing
Clean, simple, and stand alone WoW fishbot I made for myself after getting tired of all the clunky other ones. No strange DLLs. No audio stuff. No code injection stuff. It works just like you would if you were doing it yourself.

It uses the Win32 API to execute the same commands your mouse or keyboard does. Just run WoW in windowed mode (I use "windowed - full screen" from the graphics options) and put your fishing skill on keybind 1. If you are at all familiar with code you can tweak to suit your needs. I am only publishing in the interest of making available all the knowledge I had to wade through to create this.
